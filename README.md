# Image Recognition Solution

This repository contains a comprehensive solution for digits recognition using neural networks. The solution is structured into multiple projects, each handling different aspects of the digits recognition pipeline.

## Projects

### NeuralNetwork
This project contains the core neural network implementation used for image recognition.

### Sandbox
This project is used for testing and experimenting with different neural network configurations and image processing techniques.

### Drawing
This project includes resources for drawing and visualizing the results of the image recognition process. It contains an `index.html` file for web-based visualization.

### DigitsRecognitionApi
This project provides an API for digit recognition. It includes controllers and configuration files necessary for running the API.

### ImageData
This project handles image data processing, including reading and preprocessing images for the neural network.
